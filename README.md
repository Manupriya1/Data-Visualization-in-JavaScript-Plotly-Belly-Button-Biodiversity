# UCB-Plotly-Project
## Overview
In this assignment,I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which colonize in human navels.
Once deployed you will see
- Demographic Info
- Bar Chart
- Gauge Chart
- Bubble Chart

To explore the data, select an id from the dropdown menu and all the info on the demograhc panel and charts will belong to that specific ID.
